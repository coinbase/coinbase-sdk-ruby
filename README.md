# Coinbase Ruby SDK

The Coinbase Ruby SDK enables the simple integration of crypto into your app.
By calling Coinbase's Platform APIs, the SDK allows you to provision crypto wallets,
send crypto into/out of those wallets, track wallet balances, and trade crypto from
one asset into another.

The SDK currently supports Customer-custodied Wallets on the Base Sepolia test network.

**NOTE: The Coinbase SDK is currently in Alpha. The SDK:**
- **may make backwards-incompatible changes between releases**
- **should not be used on Mainnet (i.e. with real funds)**


Currently, the SDK is intended for use on testnet for quick bootstrapping of crypto wallets at
hackathons, code academies, and other development settings.

## Installation

### In Your Ruby Project

Add the following to your Gemfile:

```
gem 'coinbase-sdk'
```

Or if you are specifying dependencies in your Gemspec:

```ruby
Gem::Specification.new do |spec|
  spec.add_runtime_dependency 'coinbase-sdk'
end
```

Then run:

```bash
bundler install
```

### In the Interactive Ruby Shell (`irb`)

On the command-line, run:

```bash
gem install coinbase-sdk
```

After running `irb`, require the Gem:

```irb
require 'coinbase'
```

### Requirements

- Ruby 2.7+.

## Usage

### Initialization

The SDK requires a Base Sepolia RPC node, and uses the public instance (https://sepolia.base.org) by default.
This instance is rate-limited, but you can also provision your own on the
[Coinbase Developer Platform](https://portal.cloud.coinbase.com/products/base).


You can configure the SDK with your Base Sepolia RPC node by copying your node URL from the CDP portal 
and setting the following:

```ruby
Coinbase.base_sepolia_rpc_url = 'https://api.developer.coinbase.com/rpc/v1/base/your-node-id'
```

### Wallets and Addresses

A Wallet is a collection of Addresses on the Base Sepolia Network, which can be used to send and receive crypto.

The SDK provides customer-custodied wallets, which means that you are responsible for securely storing the data required
to re-create wallets. The following code snippet demonstrates this:

```ruby
# Create a Wallet with one Address by default.
w1 = Coinbase::Wallet.new

# Export the data required to re-create the wallet.
data = w1.export

# At this point, you should implement your own "store" method to securely persist
# the data required to re-create the wallet at a later time.
store(data)

# The wallet can be re-created using the exported data.
# w2 will be equivalent to w1.
w2 = Wallet.new(seed: data.seed, address_count: data.address_count)
```

### Transfers

The following creates an in-memory wallet. After the wallet is funded with ETH, it transfers 0.00001 ETH to a different wallet.

```ruby
# Wallets are self-custodial with in-memory key management on Base Sepolia.
# This should NOT be used in mainnet with real funds. 
w1 = Coinbase::Wallet.new

# A wallet has a default address.
a = w1.default_address
a.to_s

# At this point, fund the wallet out-of-band.
# Then, we can transfer 0.00001 ETH out of the wallet to another wallet.
w2 = Coinbase::Wallet.new

# We wait for the transfer to complete.
# Base Sepolia is fast, so it should take only a few seconds.
w1.transfer(0.00001, :eth, w2).wait!
```

## Development

### Ruby Version

Developing in this repository requires Ruby >= 2.7.0. To install this on an M2 Mac,
run the [following command](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build/discussions/2034):

```bash
RUBY_CFLAGS=-DUSE_FFI_CLOSURE_ALLOC rbenv install 2.7.0
```

### Set-up
Clone the repo by running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/coinbase/coinbase-sdk-ruby.git
```

To install all dependencies, run:

```bash
bundle install
```

This SDK transitively depends on [rbsecp256k1](https://github.com/etscrivner/rbsecp256k1). Follow
[these instructions](https://github.com/etscrivner/rbsecp256k1?tab=readme-ov-file#requirements) to
ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.

The SDK assumes the existence of a `BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL` environment variable defined in your .env file.
By default, this is the publicly available endpoint, which is rate-limited.
To provision your own endpoint, go to the [CDP Portal](https://portal.cloud.coinbase.com/products/base). Then
copy and paste your Base Sepolia RPC URL in the .env file:

```
BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=YOUR-URL
```

### Linting

To autocorrect all lint errors, run:

```bash
make format
```

To detect all lint errors, run:

```bash
make lint
```

### Testing
To run all tests, run:

```bash
make test
```

To run a specific test, run (for example):

```bash
bundle exec rspec spec/coinbase/wallet_spec.rb
```

### REPL

The repository is equipped with a REPL to allow developers to play with the SDK. To start
it, run:

```bash
make repl
```

### Generating Documentation

To generate documentation from the Ruby comments, run:

```bash
make docs
```
